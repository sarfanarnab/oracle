Step-1: ng new lab001 --style=scss --routing
Step-2: ng generate component user-item
Step-3:
	Let’s introduce name as a new property of our component. 
		name:string;
	And in the 
		constructor() { 
		this.name = 'Sami'; // set the name 
		}
	We’re saying that whenever a new UserItemComponent is created, set the name to 'Felipe'.
	RenderingTheTemplate

	When we have a property on a component, we can show that value in our template by using two curly brackets {{ }} to display the value of the variable in our template. For instance:
		<p> 2 Hello {{ name }} 3 </p>

Step-4: WorkingWithArrays
	Let’s introduce names array as a new property of our component.
		names:string[];
		constructor(){
		this.names=['Sami','Sayonti','Sejuti'];
		}		
	And we can view aboble array object in the view template like bellow
	 <ul> 2 <li *ngFor="let name of names">Hello {{ name }}</li> 3 </ul>
	
		NgFor repeats the element that the ngFor is called. That is, we put it on 
	the li tag and not the ul tag because we want to repeat the list element 
	(li) and not the list itself (ul). Note that the capitalization here isn’t
	a typo: NgFor is the capitalization of the class that implements the logic
	and ngFor is the “selector” for the attribute we want to use.

Step-5:UsingtheUserItemComponent
	Remember that earlier we created a UserItemComponent? Instead of rendering 
	each name within the UserListComponent,weoughttouse UserItemComponent 
	asachildcomponent -thatis,instead ofrenderingthetext Hello andthenamedirectly,
	weshouldletour UserItemComponent specifythe template (and functionality) of each
	item in the list. To do this, we need to do three things:
	
	1. Configure the UserListComponent to render to UserItemComponent (in the template)
	2. Configure the UserItemComponent to accept the name variable as an input and 
	3. Configure the UserListComponent template to pass the name to the UserItemComponent.
Let’s perform these steps one-by-one.
